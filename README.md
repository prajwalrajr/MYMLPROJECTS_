# MYMLPROJECTS_
This is a Classification Project and the goal of this project is to predict if a customer subscribes to the term deposit or not. Uni-Variate and Bi-Variate analysis were done at 
the begining to understand the charectoristics in the customer that affects his/her response towards marketing campaign, then statistical tests were conducted to check if the 
variable is statistically significant or not,the imbalance in the data set was handled by performing under sampling later Decision tree was considered as base model due 
to non-linear association of variables with the target but as usual decision tree was overfitting on train data set but variance error was good enough so bagging technique was
used to improve the bias error. Random Forest gave an roc_auc score of 92.3% with variance error of 0.00013 and false negative rate of 0.166.
